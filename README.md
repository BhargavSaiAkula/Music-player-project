In this project, I have created a front-end design of a music player in HTML,CSS,Java Script. 

ABOUT THIS PROJECT-:

1. This is a simple static music player created using pure HTML and CSS as part of my MERN stack course in Coding Ninjas.

2. The project has 2 pages, one for home and another for single playlist which can be accessed by clicking on any image/link of the Popular Artist Section and also through the  option provided in the nav bar. 

3. Although the website is mostly responsive, it still has some minor issues with smaller screens and needs improvements. It will be covered in updated versions.

4. For demo purposes, this project has only one song.
